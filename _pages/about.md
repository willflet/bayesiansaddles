### How would you describe yourself?

In most ways I am unremarkable. That's a given.

For a general picture of me, though... I'm an ex-academic who works with
artificial intelligence techniques, primarily machine learning. I can talk to
computers with relative ease. I'm not bad at design in a general sense, and I
love helping people succeed and be happy.

Some characteristics I like in myself are **mathematical thinking**,
**scientific curiosity**, and a **humanizing instinct**. I try to encourage and
foster these in others also.


### What's your story?

My childhood home towns are Oxford and Cambridge. As a teenager in Cambridge, my
life was dominated by music (trumpet) and church; I don't do much of either now,
but musicianship is still a core part of my identity, and my oldest friendships
grew out of church life. At school I took A-levels in Music, Chemistry, Maths
and Further Maths.

I then studied [Chemistry](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk) at Oxford, completing an
MChem in 2014. I specialized at the mathematical end of the subject, with my
final year spent on a computational project in a [crystallography group](https://goodwingroup.wordpress.com). I stayed
for a further 2 years as a PhD student and holding teaching positions.

When I fell out of love with the idea of being a chemist, I looked to pivot even
harder towards maths, in the form of a second Master's degree. I left my PhD
uncompleted, and took an MSc in [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk) at
UCL, which I finished in 2017. This was terrifying,
and brutally tough for an 'amateur' mathematician, but one of the best decisions
I have ever made.

Since then I've been rounding out my skills in industry and settling into my
new life as one of the hipster tech elites of London.

### What's your relationship with machine learning?

I studied Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at . After completing the MSc (2017) I went
into industry, where I have been


### What do you believe in?

I am a proud Bayesian, and was since my very first computational project
-- using a Monte Carlo [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Monte_Carlo)
to fold proteins. To a Bayesian, nothing is certain, but everything informs. If
there is a
I love to teach, to learn, to discover
new perspectives, to help, and to affect the world in a positive way.
