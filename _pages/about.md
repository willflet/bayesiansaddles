### How would you describe yourself?

Well I'm mostly unremarkable. That's at least a good [prior](/bayes/).

To give a quick impression, though, I'm an [ex-academic](/education/) who works
with artificial intelligence techniques -- primarily machine learning. I can
[talk to computers](/skills/) with relative ease. As for people, I value being
*an introvert's extravert*: approachable, available, and open. Above all, I enjoy
helping people to succeed and be happy.

Some characteristics I like in myself are [mathematical thinking](/mathematical_thinking/),
love of knowledge, a [humanizing](/humanizing/) instinct, and undiluted whimsy.
I try to encourage and foster these in others also.


### What's your story?

My childhood home towns are Oxford and Cambridge.

As a teenager in Cambridge, my life was dominated by music (trumpet) and church;
I don't do much of either now, but musicianship is still a core part of my
identity, and my oldest friendships grew out of church life. At school I took
A-levels in Music, Chemistry, Maths and Further Maths.

I then studied [Chemistry](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk) at Oxford, completing an
MChem in 2014. I specialized at the mathematical end of the subject, with my
final year spent on a computational project in a
[crystallography group](https://goodwingroup.wordpress.com). I stayed for a
further 2 years as a PhD student and holding teaching positions.

When I fell out of love with the idea of being a chemist, I looked to pivot even
harder towards maths, in the form of a second Master's degree. I left my PhD
uncompleted, and took an MSc in
[Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk) at
UCL, which I finished in 2017. This was a scary move for an 'amateur'
mathematician, but one of the best decisions I have ever made.

Since then I've been rounding out my skills in industry and settling into my
new life as one of the hipster tech elites of London.
