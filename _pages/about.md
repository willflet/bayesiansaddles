### How would you describe yourself?



### What's your story?

I grew up in the university cities of Oxford and Cambridge. As a teenager I spent
most of my time playing music, thanks to a
and studied at
[Oxford](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk) before that in my past life as a chemist. Now I
mostly work with computers and people, and there are far fewer hazardous
substances to worry about.


### What's your relationship with machine learning?

I studied Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at [UCL](http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk). After completing the MSc (2017) I went
into industry, where I have been rounding out my skills and using ML to
address problems in robotics, transport, human behaviour, arts, and science.


### What do you believe in?

I am a proud Bayesian, and was since my very first computational project
-- using a Monte Carlo [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Monte_Carlo)
to fold proteins. To a Bayesian, nothing is certain, but everything informs. If
there is a
I love to teach, to learn, to discover
new perspectives, to help, and to affect the world in a positive way.
