*Will is a machine learning (ML) scientist based in London.*

I learnt how to use ML at [UCL](www.csml.ucl.ac.uk), and studied at
[Oxford](www.chem.ox.ac.uk) before that in my past life as a chemist. Now I
mostly work with computers and people, and there are far fewer hazardous
substances to worry about.

I like to think about information (rather than data) and all the ways we
capture, communicate and interpret it. I love to teach, to learn, to discover
new perspectives, to help, and to affect the world in a positive way.
