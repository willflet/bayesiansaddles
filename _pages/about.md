### Who are you?

I'm this guy (you can assume I'm mostly unremarkable):

### How would you describe yourself?

To give a quick impression, I'm an [ex-academic](/about/education/) who works
with artificial intelligence techniques -- primarily machine learning. I can
[talk to computers](/about/skills/) with relative ease.

To sum up my personality I'd say I'm *an introvert's extravert*: approachable, available,
and open. Above all, I enjoy helping people to succeed and be happy.

### What drives you?

Some characteristics I like in myself are [mathematical thinking](/faq/#mathematical-thinking),
love of knowledge, a [humanizing](/faq/#humanizing) instinct, and undiluted whimsy.
These direct my everyday decisions, and I try to encourage and foster such
qualities in others as well.

Looking beyond my immediate sphere, I also care deeply about where civilization
goes next. And I hope to be involved somehow. Though many things are wonderful
about this world, I want to see one that is *more considerate* towards its present
and future occupants, and *less demanding* of attention, conformity or resources.

Literally, though? Trains.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-train"></i>


### What's your story?

I grew up in and around Oxford and Cambridge, mostly without incident.

As a teenager in Cambridge, my life was dominated by music and church --
I don't do much of either now, but musicianship is still a core part of my
identity, and my oldest friendships grew out of the church youth group. At
school I took A-levels in Music, Chemistry, Maths and Further Maths.

I then studied [Chemistry](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk) at Oxford, completing an
MChem in 2014. I specialized at the mathematical end of the subject, with my
final year spent on a computational project in a
[crystallography group](https://goodwingroup.wordpress.com). I stayed for a
further 2 years as a PhD student, holding teaching positions alongside my research.

As time went by, I fell out of love with the idea of being a chemist and tried
to pivot even harder towards maths, hoping my amateur experience would hold up.
In a move that alarmed my grandmother, I left my PhD unfinished, and took an MSc
in [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning](http://www.csml.ucl.ac.uk) at
UCL, which I finished in 2017.

Since then I've been rounding out my skills in industry and settling into my
new life as one of the hipster tech elites of London.
